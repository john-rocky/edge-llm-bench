"""Turn `YARDSTICK_NATIVE_OK` console lines into result JSON so the native row is auditable.

    python3 scripts/import_native_benchmark.py results/raw/<campaign>/console_NATIVE_*.txt

Why this exists
---------------
`runNativeBenchmark` prints its numbers and returns — it never goes through `ResultStore`, so
the LiteRT-LM vendor-`benchmark()` row (prefill exactly 1024, the ONLY card-comparable prefill
figure we can produce) lands in a `.txt` and nowhere else. `analyze_comparability.py` reads
`*.json`; `verify_published_numbers.py` indexes `results/**/*.json{,l}`. A number that exists
only in a console log is exactly the "number that exists only in prose" those two scripts were
written to refuse. This lifts the console line into the same schema the app writes, so the
native row is audited by the same tools as everything else.

What it deliberately does NOT do
--------------------------------
Invent fields the native path never measured. `runNativeBenchmark` samples memory but starts
no `ThermalSampler` and no `EnergyMonitor`, so thermal/battery/energy are written as null
rather than as a plausible-looking "nominal". `analyze_comparability.py` gates its speed table
on `initialThermalState == "nominal"`, so these rows are excluded from it by default — which
is the correct outcome: we cannot attest the thermal regime of a cell that did not record one.
Pass `--all-thermal` to inspect them anyway, and read the exclusion as a TODO for the app
(the native path should start a ThermalSampler like `BenchmarkRunner` does).

The task id is `native-benchmark-<prefill>x<decode>`, never `long-context-*`: a forced-prefill
vendor entry point and a task-prompt run are different measurements and must not pool into one
median. That separation is the whole point of the protocol's two-row structure.

# One regex over the whole line; every field is optional so older console logs (which lack
# context_tokens / median_mb / harness) still import, with the missing fields left null
# instead of silently defaulted.
#
# The value pattern is a plain `\S+` on purpose. An earlier `([-\d.]+|\?|[\w.-]+)` truncated
# `harness=2026-07-27-agreed-protocol-r2` to `2026-07-27-`, because the numeric alternative
# matched the leading date and won. A stamp that silently loses its suffix is worse than no
# stamp at all — it reads as a valid, different contract. Numeric coercion happens in `num()`,
# where a non-numeric value returns None rather than a wrong number.
